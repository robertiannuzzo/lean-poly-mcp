||| The mechanics behind `check` and `prove`: a subprocess-based typecheck
||| oracle, and an LLM-calling helper used to propose candidates for it to
||| verify.
|||
||| Idris2's elaborator (TT terms, `%search`, etc.) is baked into the `idris2`
||| compiler binary itself -- it isn't a library a separately-compiled,
||| already-running program can call into. So "the typechecker is the
||| oracle" is realized here by spawning the real `idris2` compiler as a
||| subprocess per candidate and trusting only its verdict, the same way
||| Client.idr already spawns Server.idr's binary as a subprocess.

-- Low-level primitives: the typecheck oracle and the LLM caller.
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| Wrap a bare signature + term into a checkable module. Both are taken as
||| already-formed Idris2 source fragments (e.g. `plusComm : (n, m : Nat) ->
||| n + m = m + n` and `plusComm n m = ...`). The module name here
||| (`Candidate`) must match `checkModule`'s temp file name exactly --
||| Idris2 requires module name and file name to agree.
export
wrapCandidate : (signature : String) -> (term : String) -> String
wrapCandidate signature term =
  "module Candidate\n\n%default total\n\n" ++ signature ++ "\n" ++ term ++ "\n"

readAllLines : File -> IO String
readAllLines h = go []
  where
    go : List String -> IO String
    go acc = do
      eof <- fEOF h
      if eof
         then pure (fastConcat (reverse acc))
         else do
           Right line <- fGetLine h
             | Left _ => pure (fastConcat (reverse acc))
           go (line :: acc)

||| Write `src` to a fresh temp file and run `idris2 --check` on it.
||| Right () means it typechecks; Left carries the compiler's own diagnostic
||| text verbatim, so a caller (a human, or an LLM in a repair loop) sees
||| exactly what the typechecker said.
|||
||| Two real gotchas this works around: (1) on macOS, `/tmp` is a symlink to
||| `/private/tmp`, and Idris2's source-directory check compares paths
||| literally, so a file addressed via `/tmp/...` gets rejected as "not in
||| the source directory" once it's canonicalized -- `/private/tmp` avoids
||| that. (2) Idris2 requires the file name to match the module name inside
||| it, so each check gets its own directory containing a fixed
||| `Candidate.idr`, and the check runs from *inside* that directory so no
||| ambient `.ipkg` (like this project's own `server.ipkg`) gets picked up
||| and mismatched against it.
||| Unsound escape hatches that let a term "typecheck" without actually
||| proving anything: believe_me and friends coerce anything to anything,
||| assert_* silence the totality checker, unsafePerformIO smuggles effects,
||| and %foreign/%extern let the term claim arbitrary implementations.
||| A candidate containing any of these is rejected before it ever reaches
||| the typechecker -- with believe_me, `goal : (n : Nat) -> n = S n` is
||| one line, and the oracle would accept it. (Found live, the night
||| before a demo: the model actually did this when asked to prove a
||| false statement.)

||| Evidence-carrying outcome of `check`/`prove` -- never a bare Bool, so a

||| typecheck against a goal (what `check` reports on failure) -- it is
||| never emitted by `prove`'s repair loop just because the loop ran out of
||| attempts. Absence of a proof is not evidence of falsity; that's
||| `Unknown`, not `Refuted`. Nothing in this module has a genuine
